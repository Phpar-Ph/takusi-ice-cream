### Takusi Ice Cream Site

This simple website showcases the local ice cream products from my cousinâ€™s business. I created this site as part of my learning journey as an aspiring software engineer.

The project is not yet 100% complete, as I am continuously improving my coding skills and learning new features to implement.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Tailwind CSS
- React Slick
- React Scroll
- EmailJS

## What I Learned During the Building Process

- I learned how the React framework and Tailwind CSS work together, and how efficient they are for building websites.
- I gained experience in positioning elements and implementing responsive design.
- I successfully integrated a contact form using EmailJS to allow users to send emails to the business owner.
- I learned how to style specific elements and improve layout using div positioning.
- I organized my code better by creating separate folders for datasets and storing them in objects.
- I customized Tailwind CSS and created reusable styled components for more efficient development.

## Things to Improve

- Add an order section and product review functionality
- Implement user login and authentication
- Add an admin dashboard to monitor orders
- Integrate a cloud storage provider to store data
- Improve the overall design of the website
- Add a strong call-to-action on the homepage
